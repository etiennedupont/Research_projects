# Audio classification
In this project, I am carrying out several strategies to classify sounds extracted from a bank of ~10000 samples belonging to 41 classes. After selecting the relevant features to be used for classification and vizualising them, I performed classification with several algorithms. I am now working on augmenting data in order to train CNN on the dataset.
